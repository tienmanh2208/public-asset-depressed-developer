# Selecting the right jobs

Imagine you are a freelancer, and you get a lot of jobs from website, but you only can do one job at a time. Each job pays the same fee, and you want to get as much money as possible. So, you have to find the largest possible set of jobs such that no two of them conflict with each other.

Example: You have a list of jobs as image bellow.
